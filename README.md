# Neural Models for Abstractive Text Summarisation

Repository for an independent research project at Cornell University by: Arjun Bhalla (ab2383@cornell.edu /this github) Ryan Slama (rms427@cornell.edu), Yashdeep Sahota (yss6@cornell.edu), Justin Kuang (zk65@cornell.edu), Abhimanyu Kompella (ak832@cornell.edu).

The project carried out experiments on a 4 layer LSTM model tasked with Abstractive Headline Generation from Articles. We used the CNN / DailyMail dataset. Findings written up here: https://www.arjunbhalla.com/static/neural_models.832f786e.pdf
